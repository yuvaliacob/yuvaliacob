# Hello visitor! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width = 30px> Welcome to my page.

Hi, I'm Yuval. I worked in the Internet and software industry for most of my career, starting at the age of 18, working in different positions and fields. Somewhere in the middle there I had a few years where I did several odd jobs working in bars, night clubs and even air planes before coming back to software. Sitting in a fancy office is quite comfortable, but dancing around all night and getting paid for it had it's charm. Clouds are really cool too.

#### The following is an illuminating and very comprehensive list of things I enjoy (and I'm told all have something in common but I can't quite put my finger on it)

- 💧 Water
  
- ❄️ Winter
  
- 🧇 Waffles
