# Hello visitor! Welcome to my page.

Hi, I'm Yuval. I worked in the Internet and software industry for most of my career, starting at the age of 18, working in different positions and fields. Somewhere in the middle there I had a few years where I did several odd jobs working in bars, night clubs and even air planes before coming back to software. Sitting in a fancy office is quite comfortable, but dancing around all night and getting paid for it had it's charm. Clouds are really cool too.

#### An illuminating and very comprehensive list of things I enjoy (and I'm told all have something in common but I can't quite put my finger on it)

- Water
- Winter
- Waffles
